## About me

I am currently a PhD candidate in the [Mortazavi Lab](http://crick.bio.uci.edu/) at UC Irvine. My primary area of focus is using full length RNA sequencing (long reads) to study alternative isoform usage in multiple contexts. I have developed software tools and analytical workflows designed specifically for long reads. My lab belongs to the [ENCODE Consortium](encodeproject.org) and has generated hundreds of long-read RNA-seq datasets, some of which I plan to analyze and some of which I already have. Broadly, I am interested in using multiomics to study alternative isoforms and to predict what the functional consequences of isoform choices are.

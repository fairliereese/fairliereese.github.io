Some of my colleagues (Samuel Morabito, Emmanuel Dollinger, and Axel Almet) and I started GenPALS at UC Irvine in 2020. GenPALS is a seminar series by and for researchers using genomics data. Talks are informal and specifically geared towards reviewing or providing a reproducible tutorial of software available for analyzing high-throughput genomics data. The goal of this series is to provide the researchers that are responsible for analyzing said data with the knowledge, resources, and tools to do so.

We have also held intro workshops on analyzing scRNA-seq data complete with self-contained runnable code tutorials.

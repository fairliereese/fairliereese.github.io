Swan is a Python library I developed for the visualization and analysis of long-read transcriptomes. Swan can produce unique graph-based visualizations of splicing within genes. Swan can additionally perform differential gene and transcript expression testing, find isoform-switching genes, and find novel intron retention and exon skipping events.

Some of my colleagues (Samuel Morabito, Emmanuel Dollinger, and Axel Almet) and I started GenPALS at UC Irvine in 2020. GenPALS is a seminar series by and for researchers using genomics data. Talks are informal and specifically geared towards reviewing or providing a reproducible tutorial of software available for analyzing high-throughput genomics data. The goal of this series is to provide the researchers that are responsible for analyzing said data with the knowledge, resources, and tools to do so.

Over the last few years I've been asked to create and present tutorials on how to analyze long-read RNA-seq data, so I've compiled those resources here.

* [2022 GenPALS Seminar: Analysis of C2C12 LR-Split-seq data and showcase of new Swan features](https://github.com/fairliereese/220124_swan_genpals)
* [2021 UC Davis IsoSeq Workshop: Analysis of C2C12 LR-Split-seq data](https://github.com/fairliereese/210830_ucd_workshop)
* [2021 GenPALS Seminar: Analysis of PGP1 and PGP1-derived cell lines](https://github.com/fairliereese/210413_pgp1)

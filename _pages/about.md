## About me

she / her

I am currently a PhD candidate in the [Mortazavi Lab](http://crick.bio.uci.edu/) at UC Irvine. My primary area of focus is using full length RNA sequencing (long reads) to study alternative isoform usage in multiple contexts. I have developed software tools and analytical workflows designed specifically for long reads. My lab belongs to the [ENCODE Consortium](https://www.encodeproject.org) and has generated [numerous long-read RNA-seq datasets](https://www.encodeproject.org/search/?type=Experiment&control_type%21=%2A&assay_title=long+read+RNA-seq) which I am largely in charge of analyzing. Broadly, I am interested in using multiomics to study alternative isoforms and to predict what the functional consequences of isoform choices are.  

Outside of work, I love to hang out with my kitties, listen to rock music, play video games and TTRPGs, hike and go to the beach, and eat Mexican food.

You can reach me at freese {at} uci.edu.

## About me

I am currently a PhD candidate in the [Mortazavi Lab](http://crick.bio.uci.edu/) at UC Irvine. My primary area of focus is using full length RNA sequencing (long reads) to study alternative isoform usage in multiple contexts. I have developed software tools and analytical workflows designed specifically for long reads. My lab belongs to the [ENCODE Consortium](https://www.encodeproject.org) and has generated [numerous long-read RNA-seq datasets](https://www.encodeproject.org/search/?type=Experiment&control_type%21=%2A&assay_title=long+read+RNA-seq), some of which I plan to analyze and some of which I already have. Broadly, I am interested in using multiomics to study alternative isoforms and to predict what the functional consequences of isoform choices are.  

Outside of work, I love to hang out with my kitties, listen to rock music, play video games and TTRPGs, hike and go to the beach, eat Mexican food, and drink beer.

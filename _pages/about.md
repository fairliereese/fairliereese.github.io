## About me

she / her

I am currently a postdoc in the [Transcriptomics and Functional Genomics Lab](https://www.bsc.es/discover-bsc/organisation/scientific-structure/transcriptomics-and-functional-genomics-lab-tfgl) led by Dr. Melé at the [Barcelona Supercomputing Center](https://www.bsc.es/). Before, I completed my PhD in the [Mortazavi Lab](http://crick.bio.uci.edu/) at UC Irvine.   

My primary area of focus is using full length RNA sequencing (long reads) to study alternative isoform usage in multiple biological contexts. I have developed software tools and analytical workflows designed specifically for long reads. My PhD lab belonged to the [ENCODE Consortium](https://www.encodeproject.org) and has generated [numerous long-read RNA-seq datasets](https://www.encodeproject.org/search/?type=Experiment&control_type%21=%2A&assay_title=long+read+RNA-seq) which I am largely in charge of analyzing. Broadly, I am interested in using multiomics to study alternative isoforms and to predict what the functional consequences of isoform choices are. Furthermore, I'm interested in how genetic and phenotypic variation affect the transcriptome and functional genome.

Outside of work, I love to hang out with my kitties, listen to rock music, play video games and TTRPGs, hike and go to the beach, and eat Mexican food.

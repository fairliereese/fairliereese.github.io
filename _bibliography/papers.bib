  title={{Exon Size and Sequence Conservation Improves Identification of Splice Altering Nucleotides}},
  abstract={Pre-mRNA splicing is regulated through multiple trans-acting splicing factors. These regulators interact with the pre-mRNA at intronic and exonic positions. Given that most exons are protein coding, the evolution of exons must be modulated by a combination of selective coding and splicing pressures. It has previously been demonstrated that selective splicing pressures are more easily deconvoluted when phylogenetic comparisons are made for exons of identical size, suggesting that exon size-filtered sequence alignments may improve identification of nucleotides evolved to mediate efficient exon ligation. To test this hypothesis, an exon size database was created, filtering 76 vertebrate sequence alignments based on exon size conservation. In addition to other genomic parameters, such as splice site strength, gene position or flanking intron length, this database permits identification of exons that are size and/or sequence conserved. Highly size-conserved exons are always sequence conserved. However, sequence conservation does not necessitate exon size conservation. Our analysis identified evolutionarily young exons and demonstrated that length conservation is a strong predictor of alternative splicing. A published dataset of ~5000 exonic SNPs associated with disease was analyzed to test the hypothesis that exon size-filtered sequence comparisons increase detection of splice-altering nucleotides. Improved splice predictions could be achieved when mutations occur at the third codon position, especially when a mutation decreases exon inclusion efficiency. The results demonstrate that coding pressures dominate nucleotide composition at invariable codon positions and that exon-size filtered sequence alignments permit identification of splice-altering nucleotides at wobble positions.},

  title={{Swan: a library for the analysis and visualization of long-read transcriptomes}},
  abstract={Motivation
    Long-read RNA-sequencing technologies such as PacBio and Oxford Nanopore have discovered an explosion of new transcript isoforms that are difficult to visually analyze using currently available tools. We introduce the Swan Python library, which is designed to analyze and visualize transcript models.

    Results
    Swan finds 4909 differentially expressed transcripts between cell lines HepG2 and HFFc6, including 279 that are differentially expressed even though the parent gene is not. Additionally, Swan discovers 285 reproducible exon skipping and 47 intron retention events not recorded in the GENCODE v29 annotation.

    Availability and implementation
    The Swan library for Python 3 is available on PyPi at https://pypi.org/project/swan-vis/ and on GitHub at https://github.com/mortazavilab/swan_vis.},

  abstract={Alternative splicing is widely acknowledged to be a crucial regulator of gene expression and is a key contributor to both normal developmental processes and disease states. While cost-effective and accurate for quantification, short-read RNA-seq lacks the ability to resolve full-length transcript isoforms despite increasingly sophisticated computational methods. Long-read sequencing platforms such as Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) and Oxford Nanopore (ONT) bypass the transcript reconstruction challenges of short reads. Here we introduce TALON, the ENCODE4 pipeline for platform-independent analysis of long-read transcriptomes. We apply TALON to the GM12878 cell line and show that while both PacBio and ONT technologies perform well at full-transcript discovery and quantification, each displayed distinct technical artifacts. We further apply TALON to mouse hippocampus and cortex transcriptomes and find that 422 genes found in these regions have more reads associated with novel isoforms than with annotated ones. We demonstrate that TALON is a capable of tracking both known and novel transcript models as well as their expression levels across datasets for both simple studies and in larger projects. These properties will enable TALON users to move beyond the limitations of short-read data to perform isoform discovery and quantification in a uniform manner on existing and future long-read platforms.},

  title={Mapping and modeling the genomic basis of differential RNA isoform expression at single-cell resolution with LR-Split-seq},
  abstract={Alternative RNA isoforms are defined by promoter choice, alternative splicing, and polyA site selection. Although differential isoform expression is known to play a large regulatory role in eukaryotes, it has proved challenging to study with standard short-read RNA-seq because of the uncertainties it leaves about the full-length structure and precise termini of transcripts. The rise in throughput and quality of long-read sequencing now makes it possible, in principle, to unambiguously identify most transcript isoforms from beginning to end. However, its application to single-cell RNA-seq has been limited by throughput and expense. Here, we develop and characterize long-read Split-seq (LR-Split-seq), which uses a combinatorial barcoding-based method for sequencing single cells and nuclei with long reads. We show that LR-Split-seq can associate isoforms with cell types with relative economy and design flexibility. We characterize LR-Split-seq for whole cells and nuclei by using the well-studied mouse C2C12 system in which mononucleated myoblast cells differentiate and fuse into multinucleated myotubes. We show that the overall results are reproducible when comparing long- and short-read data from the same cell or nucleus. We find substantial evidence of differential isoform expression during differentiation including alternative transcription start site (TSS) usage. We integrate the resulting isoform expression dynamics with snATAC-seq chromatin accessibility to validate TSS-driven isoform choices. LR-Split-seq provides an affordable method for identifying cluster-specific isoforms in single cells that can be further quantified with companion deep short-read scRNA-seq from the same cell populations.},

Gene collections such as GENCODE contain annotations for tens of thousands of TSSs, but not all of these annotations are experimentally validated, nor do they contain information on cell type-specific usage. Therefore, we sought to generate a collection of experimentally validated TSSs by integrating RNA Annotation and Mapping of Promoters for the Analysis of Gene Expression (RAMPAGE) data from 115 cell and tissue types, which resulted in a collection of approximately 50 thousand representative RAMPAGE peaks. These peaks were primarily proximal to GENCODE-annotated TSSs and were concordant with other transcription assays. Because RAMPAGE uses paired-end reads, we were then able to connect peaks to transcripts by analyzing the genomic positions of the 3' ends of read mates. Using this paired-end information, we classified the vast majority (37 thousand) of our RAMPAGE peaks as verified TSSs, updating TSS annotations for 20\% of GENCODE genes. We also found that these updated TSS annotations were supported by epigenomic and other transcriptomic datasets. To demonstrate the utility of this RAMPAGE rPeak collection, we intersected it with the NHGRI/EBI genome-wide association studies (GWAS) catalog and identified new candidate GWAS genes. Overall, our work demonstrates the importance of integrating experimental data to further refine TSS annotations and provides a valuable resource for the biological community.}},

  abstract={{Acoustic deterrents can reduce marine mammal interactions with fisheries and aquacultures, but they contribute to an increasing level of underwater noise. In Southern California, commercially produced explosive deterrents, commonly known as “seal bombs,” are used to protect fishing gear and catch from pinniped predation, which can cause extensive economic losses for the fishing community. Passive acoustic monitoring data collected between 2005 and 2016 at multiple sites within the Southern California Bight and near Monterey Bay revealed high numbers of these small-charge underwater explosions, long-term, spatio-temporal patterns in their occurrence, and their relation to different commercial purse-seine fishing sectors. The vast majority of explosions occurred at nighttime and at many nearshore sites high explosion counts were detected, up to 2,800/day. Received sound exposure levels of up to 189 dB re 1 μPa2-s indicate the potential for negative effects on marine life, especially in combination with the persistence of recurring explosions during periods of peak occurrence. Due to the highly significant correlation and similar spatio-temporal patterns of market squid landings and explosion occurrence at many sites, we conclude that the majority of the recorded explosions come from seal bombs being used by the California market squid purse-seine fishery. Additionally, seal bomb use declined over the years of the study, potentially due to a combination of reduced availability of market squid driven by warm water events in California and regulation enforcement. This study is the first to provide results on the distribution and origin of underwater explosions off Southern California, but there is a substantial need for further research on seal bomb use in more recent years and their effects on marine life, as well as for establishing environmental regulations on their use as a deterrent.}},

However, the current R implementation is slow, is not designed to compare modules between multiple WGCNA networks, and its results can be hard to interpret as well as to visualize. We introduce the PyWGCNA Python package, which is designed to identify co-expression modules from large RNA-seq datasets. PyWGCNA has a faster implementation than the R version of WGCNA and several additional downstream analysis modules for functional enrichment analysis using GO, KEGG and REACTOME, inter-module analysis of protein-protein interactions, as well as comparison of multiple co-expression modules to each other and/or external lists of genes such as marker genes from single-cell. Results We apply PyWGCNA to two distinct datasets of brain bulk RNA-seq from MODEL-AD to identify modules associated with the genotypes. We compare the resulting modules to each other to find shared co-expression signatures in the form of modules with significant overlap across the datasets.

All experimental data, metadata, and associated computational analyses created by the ENCODE consortium are submitted to the Data Coordination Center (DCC) for validation, tracking, storage, and distribution to community resources and the scientific community. The ENCODE project has engineered and distributed uniform processing pipelines in order to promote data provenance and reproducibility as well as allow interoperability between genomic resources and other consortia. All data files, reference genome versions, software versions, and parameters used by the pipelines are captured and available via the ENCODE Portal. The pipeline code, developed using Docker and Workflow Description Language (WDL; https://openwdl.org/ ) is publicly available in GitHub, with images available on Dockerhub ( https://hub.docker.com ), enabling access to a diverse range of biomedical researchers. ENCODE pipelines maintained and used by the DCC can be installed to run on personal computers, local HPC clusters, or in cloud computing environments via Cromwell. Access to the pipelines and data via the cloud allows small labs the ability to use the data or software without access to institutional compute clusters. Standardization of the computational methodologies for analysis and quality control leads to comparable results from different ENCODE collections - a prerequisite for successful integrative analyses.

We used an ensemble Latent Dirichlet Allocation strategy with a curated vocabulary of 2,701 regulatory genes to identify regulatory "topics," each of which is a gene vector, linked to cell type differentiation, subtype specialization, and transitions between cell states. We find recurrent regulatory topics in tissue-resident macrophages, neural cell types, endothelial cells across multiple tissues, and cycling cells of the adrenal gland and heart. Cell-type-specific topics are enriched in transcription factors and microRNA host genes, while chromatin regulators dominate mitosis topics. Corresponding chromatin accessibility data reveal dynamic and sex-specific regulatory elements, with enriched motifs matching transcription factors in regulatory topics.

  abstract = {{Pathogenic loss-of-function SCN1A variants cause a spectrum of seizure disorders. We previously identified variants in individuals with SCN1A-related epilepsy that fall in or near a poison exon (PE) in SCN1A intron 20 (20N). We hypothesized these variants lead to increased PE inclusion, which introduces a premature stop codon, and, therefore, reduced abundance of the full-length SCN1A transcript and Nav1.1 protein. We used a splicing reporter assay to interrogate PE inclusion in HEK293T cells. In addition, we used patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) differentiated into neurons to quantify 20N inclusion by long and short-read sequencing and Nav1.1 abundance by western blot. We performed RNA-antisense purification with mass spectrometry to identify RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) that could account for the aberrant PE splicing. We demonstrate that variants in/near 20N lead to increased 20N inclusion by long-read sequencing or splicing reporter assay and decreased Nav1.1 abundance. We also identified 28 RBPs that differentially interact with variant constructs compared to wild-type, including SRSF1 and HNRNPL. We propose a model whereby 20N variants disrupt RBP binding to splicing enhancers (SRSF1) and suppressors (HNRNPL), to favor PE inclusion. Overall, we demonstrate that SCN1A 20N variants cause haploinsufficiency and SCN1A-related epilepsies. This work provides insights into the complex control of RBP-mediated PE alternative splicing, with broader implications for PE discovery and identification of pathogenic PE variants in other genetic conditions}},

Here we present a spatial transcriptomic (ST) and single-nucleus transcriptomic survey of late-onset sporadic AD and AD in Down syndrome (DSAD). Studying DSAD provides an opportunity to enhance our understanding of the AD transcriptome, potentially bridging the gap between genetic mouse models and sporadic AD. We identified transcriptomic changes that may underlie cortical layer-preferential pathology accumulation. Spatial co-expression network analyses revealed transient and regionally restricted disease processes, including a glial inflammatory program dysregulated in upper cortical layers and implicated in AD genetic risk and amyloid-associated processes. Cell–cell communication analysis further contextualized this gene program in dysregulated signaling networks. Finally, we generated ST data from an amyloid AD mouse model to identify cross-species amyloid-proximal transcriptomic changes with conformational context. Spatial and single-nucleus analyses in human postmortem Alzheimer’s disease (AD) brain tissues at early and late stages from individuals with and without Down syndrome, as well as in AD mouse models, show sex and species-specific phenotypic changes.}},

abstract = {{RNA abundance quantification has become routine and affordable thanks to high-throughput “short-read” technologies that provide accurate molecule counts at the gene level. Similarly accurate and affordable quantification of definitive full-length, transcript isoforms has remained a stubborn challenge, despite its obvious biological significance across a wide range of problems. “Long-read” sequencing platforms now produce data-types that can, in principle, drive routine definitive iso-form quantification. However some particulars of contemporary long-read datatypes, together with isoform complexity and genetic variation, present bioinformatic challenges. We show here, using ONT data, that fast and accurate quantification of long-read data is possible and that it is improved by exome capture. To perform quantifications we developed lr-kallisto, which adapts the kallisto bulk and single-cell RNA-seq quantification methods for long-read technologies.}},

abstract = {{The gene expression profiles of distinct cell types reflect complex genomic interactions among multiple simultaneous biological processes within each cell that can be altered by disease progression as well as genetic background. The identification of these active cellular programs is an open challenge in the analysis of single-cell RNA-seq data. Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is a generative method used to identify recurring patterns in counts data, commonly referred to as topics that can be used to interpret the state of each cell. However, LDA’s interpretability is hindered by several key factors including the hyperparameter selection of the number of topics as well as the variability in topic definitions due to random initialization. We developed Topyfic, a Reproducible LDA (rLDA) package, to accurately infer the identity and activity of cellular programs in single-cell data, providing insights into the relative contributions of each program in individual cells. We apply Topyfic to brain single-cell and single-nucleus datasets of two 5xFAD mouse models of Alzheimer’s disease crossed with C57BL6/J or CAST/EiJ mice to identify distinct cell types and states in different cell types such as microglia. We find that 8-month 5xFAD/Cast F1 males show higher level of microglial activation than matching 5xFAD/BL6 F1 males, whereas female mice show similar levels of microglial activation. We show that regulatory genes such as TFs, microRNA host genes, and chromatin regulatory genes alone capture cell types and cell states. Our study highlights how topic modeling with a limited vocabulary of regulatory genes can identify gene expression programs in singlecell data in order to quantify similar and divergent cell states in distinct genotypes.}},

abstract = {{Our genomes influence nearly every aspect of human biology—from molecular and cellular functions to phenotypes in health and disease. Studying the differences in DNA sequence between individuals (genomic variation) could reveal previously unknown mechanisms of human biology, uncover the basis of genetic predispositions to diseases, and guide the development of new diagnostic tools and therapeutic agents. Yet, understanding how genomic variation alters genome function to influence phenotype has proved challenging. To unlock these insights, we need a systematic and comprehensive catalogue of genome function and the molecular and cellular effects of genomic variants. Towards this goal, the Impact of Genomic Variation on Function (IGVF) Consortium will combine approaches in single-cell mapping, genomic perturbations and predictive modelling to investigate the relationships among genomic variation, genome function and phenotypes. IGVF will create maps across hundreds of cell types and states describing how coding variants alter protein activity, how noncoding variants change the regulation of gene expression, and how such effects connect through gene-regulatory and protein-interaction networks. These experimental data, computational predictions and accompanying standards and pipelines will be integrated into an open resource that will catalyse community efforts to explore how our genomes influence biology and disease across populations. The Impact of Genomic Variation on Function Consortium is combining single-cell mapping, genomic perturbations and predictive modelling to investigate relationships between human genomic variation, genome function and phenotypes and will provide an open resource to the community.}},

Previously, The ENCODE consortium mapped biochemical signals across many cell types and tissues and integrated these data to develop a Registry of 0.9 million human and 300 thousand mouse candidate cis-Regulatory Elements (cCREs) annotated with potential functions1. We have expanded the Registry to include 2.35 million human and 927 thousand mouse cCREs, leveraging new ENCODE datasets and enhanced computational methods. This expanded Registry covers hundreds of unique cell and tissue types, providing a comprehensive understanding of gene regulation. Functional characterization data from assays like STARR-seq, MPRA, CRISPR perturbation, and transgenic mouse assays now cover over 90\% of human cCREs, revealing complex regulatory functions. We identified thousands of novel silencer cCREs and demonstrated their dual enhancer/silencer roles in different cellular contexts. Integrating the Registry with other ENCODE annotations facilitates genetic variation interpretation and trait-associated gene identification, exemplified by discovering KLF1 as a novel causal gene for red blood cell traits. This expanded Registry is a valuable resource for studying the regulatory genome and its impact on health and disease.}},
